# DAFT Package Challenge

🎨 **Recreating the Scurvy DAGs with Beautiful Visualizations**

This repository contains a data science challenge focused on mastering the DAFT (Directed Acyclic Factor Graphs Toolkit) package to create professional-quality probabilistic graphical models.

## 📊 Challenge Overview

The challenge involves recreating three historical Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that tell the fascinating story of how we lost and rediscovered the cure to scurvy:

1. **1747 Understanding:** Lemons prevent scurvy (correct but incomplete)
2. **Misguided Belief:** Acid kills bacteria that causes scurvy (wrong)
3. **1928 Understanding:** Vitamin C prevents scurvy (the real mechanism)
